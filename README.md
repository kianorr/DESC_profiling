# DESC_profiling

## Goals
1. To profile the performance of the Zernike Polynomial evaluation and its derivatives on the current version of DESC.
2. To implement the recursive evaluation of the Zernike Polynomial evaluation through the Jacobi Polynomial evaluation.
3. To profile the performance of the Zernike Polynomial evaluation through the Jacobi Polynomial evaluation.
4. To implement the modified Prata's method to reduce the computation time and RAM requirements of the Zernike Polynomial evaluation.
5. To profile the performance of the modified Prata's method to reduce the computation time and RAM requirements of the Zernike Polynomial evaluation.
