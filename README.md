# DESC_profiling

## Goals
1. To profile the performance of the Zernike Polynomial evaluation and its derivatives on the current version of DESC.
2. To implement \textcolor{red}{the recursive evaluation} of the Zernike Polynomial evaluation through the Jacobi Polynomial evaluation.
3. To profile the performance of \textcolor{red}{of the Zernike Polynomial evaluation} through the Jacobi Polynomial evaluation.
4. To implement \textcolor{red}{a new approach} to reduce the computation time and RAM requirements of the Zernike Polynomial evaluation.
5. To profile the performance of \textcolor{red}{the new approach} to reduce the computation time and RAM requirements of the Zernike Polynomial evaluation.
